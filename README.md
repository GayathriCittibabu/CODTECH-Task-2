Overview of the Project

This Weather App fetches and displays real-time weather information for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

HTML Structure:

The app has an input field to enter the city name and a search button.
It displays weather details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon.
CSS (referenced externally):

Provides the styling for the layout, including the card design and weather display.
JavaScript:

The checkWeather() function triggers when the search button is clicked. It fetches the weather data from OpenWeatherMap using the entered city name.
If the city is found, it updates the temperature, city name, humidity, and wind speed dynamically.
If the city is not found, an alert notifies the user.
This creates an interactive weather app that retrieves and displays current weather conditions based on user input.
